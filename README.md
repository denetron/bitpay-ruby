`bitpay-ruby` is a library for interacting with the BitPay.com Bitcoin Payment Gateway API. It is based on the [Bitcoin Payment Gateway API v0.3](https://bitpay.com/downloads/bitpayApi-0.3.pdf).

## Instructions

Using this API, you can:
* create an invoice
* fetch an invoice status
* receive invoice status updates

## Contributing
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please do not change the Rakefile.
